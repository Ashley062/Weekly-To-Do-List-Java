# Java Weekly To-Do List

## Project Goal

The goal is to create a weekly to-do list in Java where:

- Tasks can be added for each day of the week.  
- Tasks can be marked to repeat for multiple days.  
- Tasks can be prioritized to manage them effectively.  

The program will help users organize their tasks, prioritize them, and manage recurring activities, providing a structured way to track their weekly goals.

## Why This Project?

This project addresses a practical need by helping people stay organized. By incorporating features like task prioritization and repeating tasks, the application will be useful in real life.  

Additionally, this project will help me practice important concepts such as:  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- File handling (for saving data)  
- User input/output management in Java  

---

## User Interaction

The user will supply the data, which includes:

- Task names/descriptions  
- Days of the week (for when tasks should occur)  
- Priority levels (e.g., low, medium, high)  
- Whether or not the task repeats  

---

## Program Workflow

The program will require interaction with the user throughout its operation. The user will:

- Add tasks to specific days  
- Choose priorities for tasks  
- Decide if a task repeats  
- View their weekly to-do list  

The user will input data interactively, and the program will display the updated list of tasks. The program will continuously prompt the user for actions (add, view, edit, remove tasks, etc.) until they choose to exit.

## Final Features

By the end of this project, the user will have a fully functional weekly to-do list that allows them to:

- View tasks assigned to each day of the week  
- Add new tasks with the option to set priority and repetition  
- Edit or delete existing tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed

## Future Enhancements

- Task reminders  
- Task statistics and insights  
- Export/Import task lists
